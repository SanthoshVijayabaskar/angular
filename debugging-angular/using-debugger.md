# Using Debugger

Google’s Chrome has its own **debugger** tool to create a breakpoint in our code. The debugger statement will cause the browser to freeze during execution, allowing us to examine the running code from inside the actual application and at the point of execution inside the browser.

When we’re done debugging the application code, we need to make sure we **remove this line**, because it will freeze the browser, even in production.
