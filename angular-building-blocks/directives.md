# Directives

Angular lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives. 

* Built-in Directives \(attributes starts with the prefix ng-\)
* Custom Directives 

There are **3 kinds of directives** in Angular: 

1. **Components**—directives with a template. 
2. **Structural directives** — Change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. — **NgIf, NgForOf, NgSwitch** 
3. **Attribute directives** —listen to and modify the behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components. — **NgClass, NgStyle, NgModel**
